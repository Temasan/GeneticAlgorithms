# GeneticAlgorithms
Three projects with a genetics algorithms, whitch solved mathematics problem with the use inaccurate logic.

First project solve problem with searching point maximun in nonlinear 2-D mathematics function.
Second project solve problem with searching point minimum in nonlinear 3-D mathematics function of Rastrigin.
Third project solve the traveling salesman problem.
